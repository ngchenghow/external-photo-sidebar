External Photo Sidebar

External Photo Sidebar is an Obsidian plugin that lets you view and use images stored outside your vault â€” like from your desktop, external hard drive, or NAS.
You can browse photos directly in a sidebar, then insert or import them into your notes easily.

ðŸŒŸ What You Can Do

- Browse photos from any folder on your computer (even outside your vault).
- Click to insert an image into your note â€” as an embed, markdown link, or pasted image.
- Import images into your vault folder with automatic file renaming.
- Drag and drop photos straight into notes.
- See previews, file names, and EXIF info (like date or size).
- Auto-refresh when images change in your folder.
